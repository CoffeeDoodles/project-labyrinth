We had to use React Redux to create a classic adventure word game, which retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items. Aka Buttons that sent the user in a specific direction.


## The problem

Grasping how to use THUNKS for the first API fetches proved tricky for us, in the beginning we couldn't understand how to configure the fetch request using header, and body properly. We ended up using Postman more as a tool to help us figure out how to work properly with the API.

We also had trouble getting the logic to work for our ending page, the conditional rendering wasn't set up properly in our logic. After trying a few different options, we finally found a logical approach that DID work, and it was SO SATISFYING! 

If we had more time, we would love to add more styling such as individual backgrounds, or perhaps a better animated loader. It would be nice to put a limit or a notification if a username is too long or reused.
